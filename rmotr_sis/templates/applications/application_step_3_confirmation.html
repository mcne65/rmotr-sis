    <p>Sadly there's no room for everyone, and we need to do a selection of the most commited applicants. We will notify you both either you were selected or not.</p>
    <p>The course tuition is $300, and you will only have to pay if you are one of the selected applicants. If you can not afford that amount of money, please read the following section.</p>
